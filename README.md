## Inspiration

Homeless services have been around for a long time, but because of the skills gap in the nonprofit workforce and the technology industry, user-friendly solutions have unfortunately not evolved to support vulnerable populations. Monetary, organizational resources and talent constraints have long fettered homeless services from providing a level of service present in many experiences.

80% of those who have died from the COVID-19 virus are 65 and older. In elderly homeless populations, where individuals typically present with geriatric issues of those 15 years older than their actual age, this figure is expected to be significantly worse. In this scenario, technologies such as AI/IOT can be re-envisioned to provide a powerful solution.


## What it does

Varna makes it simple by developing a technology-based enterprise solution to onboard, screen and monitor the health of vulnerable homeless individuals, with an emphasis on the elderly. Varna is an out of the box IoT and web-based platform. Any emergency shelter operator can use it to instantly manage the influx of non-critical care patients from the street or local hospital.  This will help hospitals focus on intensive care patients rather than patients who are not yet symptomatic.   

## How we built it

**Team Varna** utilized various technologies from UI prototyping tools, relational databases, web development tools, scripting languages and various APIs to build the system. The **frontend** of our web application was customized using HTML5, CSS3, JQuery, Javascript plugins and AJAX to incorporate multiple features that would enable users to seamlessly interact. The system **backend** was developed using PHP and MySQL. We also integrated various Google APIs to manage location data.

The web application also features a conversational chatbot that would pre-screen users who are en-route to the referred shelter. The chatbot also provides a unique QR code and further steps to proceed. The thermal camera recognizes the QR code and links the measured temperature readings to the user’s health records. 

The **shelter staff** can login to a custom dashboard on our web application to get an overview of the occupants in the shelter, receive real-time notifications about the patient’s health status and view details about nearby shelters and hospitals. This enables the staff to take prompt action in case of emergencies. 

The **user** can login to our portal with a registered phone number to view room/bed allocation details, get health status notifications (from wearables, thermal camera etc.) and other resources to aid their stay in the shelter.
